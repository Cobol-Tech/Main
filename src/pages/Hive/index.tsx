        <h2 className="text-4xl ">Objectives</h2>
        <p>Our primary objective is to address the limitations of existing educational platforms, including Discord, Chalkpad, and Microsoft Teams, by offering a single cohesive application tailored specifically for students.

By building stronger communities, we're hoping to encourage students to work together, share ideas, and support each other. At the same time, we're focused on making the platform easy to use and enjoyable, so students can focus on their studies without any distractions. Ultimately, we're confident that these changes will lead to more engagement from students, making learning a more exciting and rewarding experience for everyone involved.</p>
